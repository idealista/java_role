## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the role for your ansible playbook. Once launched, it will install Java on ubuntu via ppa and sets the same ppa on Debian using trusty version

### Prerequisities

Ansible 2.2.1.0 version installed.
Inventory destination should be a Debian environment.

For testing purposes, [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/) with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) as driver and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) as provider.

```

Install the role with ansible-galaxy command:

```

Use in a playbook:

```

    - { role: java,
        java_set_version: '8'
      }
```
